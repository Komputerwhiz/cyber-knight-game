I’m building an interactive, illustrated children’s storybook web game called “The Cyber Knight Chronicles: Lyra and the Locked Gate.” The player follows Lyra, a young cyber-knight in training, as she makes choices to protect her digital world. Each scene presents a challenge or decision tied to online safety and emotional growth.

Please generate a full set of illustrated assets for this game. Each image must:

Be designed for mobile-first gameplay (responsive in portrait and landscape)

Include safe margins for narration at the top and large choice buttons at the bottom

Follow a bold, clean, cinematic style appropriate for children aged 7–11

Be visually consistent across all scenes and badges

✨ 🎨 Art Style Directive (IMPORTANT)
Style:
Animated film hybrid — combine Pixar’s clean, expressive character designs and lighting clarity with Studio Ghibli’s magical, atmospheric worldbuilding.
Characters should have bold outlines, distinct features, and cinematic lighting. Backgrounds should blend fantasy and technology (glowing runes, castles made of firewalls, pop-ups as floating holograms). UI elements should feel magical yet digital, with glowing glyphs, tokens, and badge-like motifs. Prioritize emotional readability, clarity of action, and consistent visual tone across all assets.

Color Palette: Bright but grounded; use glowing blues, purples, and golds to convey trust, wisdom, and magic. Avoid soft watercolor looks or overly washed-out tones.

📦 Assets to Generate
🎮 Choice-Based Story Scenes (Safe/Unsafe Decisions)
Chapter 1 – Suspicious Pop-Up:
Lyra stands at a crossroads in Netkeep. A pop-up floats midair: “Click for Free Power!” One path looks safe, glowing with security glyphs; the other glows red and glitchy. She looks unsure.

Chapter 2 – The Unlocked Portal:
Lyra approaches a shimmering portal in the castle wall. It’s open, unsecured. A familiar voice asks to come through. Lyra hesitates, hand near a glowing lock.

Chapter 3 – The Phishing Scroll:
Lyra reads a scroll claiming to be from her mentor, G.H.O.S.T., asking for her password. The scroll glows unnaturally. She frowns, sensing something’s wrong.

❌ Wrong Path Consequences (Feedback Scenes)
Chapter 1 – Pop-Up Trap:
Lyra is surrounded by glitchy, aggressive pop-ups offering fake upgrades. Her shield dims. G.H.O.S.T. watches from above, concerned.

Chapter 2 – Portal Breach:
Dark code mist leaks from the open portal. Friendly glyphs vanish. Lyra looks stunned.

Chapter 3 – Password Phishing:
The scroll melts into red smoke. A shadowy figure fades behind Lyra. She clutches her token, realizing her mistake.

🏅 Badge Scenes (Success Moments)
Pause Badge:
A glowing digital badge shaped like a shield with a pause symbol in the center. Blue and gold light radiates outward. Magical tech aesthetic.

Gatekeeper Badge:
A golden key over a stylized vault door. Lock symbols orbit it like satellites. Futuristic medieval vibe.

Trust Token:
A round, radiant token etched with Lyra’s sigil (star + lock) and G.H.O.S.T.’s eye in the center. Surrounded by animated circuit lines.

🏁 Final Victory Screen
Cyber Sentinel Knighting:
Lyra stands atop the castle firewall tower at sunset. She wears a glowing purple cape. The three badges float above her. Stars swirl into binary constellations. Her sword is raised in triumph.

✅ Export Notes
Format: High-resolution PNG or JPG

Each file must be clearly named by purpose (e.g., chapter1_choice.png, badge_trust_token.png)

Leave visual room for in-game text overlays

Use consistent lighting and character scale across scenes

This prompt sets up Manus to deliver a unified, game-ready, visually stunning set of assets.

Ready to feed this in and build around it. I’ll be here with the React prototype, game logic, and badge system whenever you're ready to plug it in.
